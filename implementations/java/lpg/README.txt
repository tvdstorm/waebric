Notes: 

* Lpg java runtime in lpgdependency folder should be used (already referenced by the current .classpath file
* The current parser implementation can not paste the default path element as defined in Waebric spec. 
The path needs to be prefixed with / or ./ (already adapted by the example files in the current directory)


* Create application configuration to run the program. Main class should be waebricc.Main ; file name (input test file) 
should be provided as argument
* PrettyPrinter shall produce AST tree in a readable format in the output console
