- Bug in Intellipad higlighting which highlights a keyword when not matching the specified token rule. This suggests that it's parsed incorrect, which isn't the case.
- Due problems with tokens some tokens could not defined so strictly idcon.idcon and idcon.   idcon is parsed the same.
- Problems with Filename token. Added extra restrictions to directory and filenames according to Windows Directory/Filename convention.
- Problems with some list constructions which should be straight-recursive to be handled correctly. Due this problem also syntax* does
not work correctly and needs such alternative list constructions
